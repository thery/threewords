Algorithm 12 is to Algorithm 11 exactly what Algorithm 10 is to Algorithm 9:
the low word `e₄ = (c + z₃) − s₃` is dropped. Equivalently, **Algorithm 12 is
Algorithm 10 with `x₂ = 0`** — which is how correctness is inherited.

## Part 1 — correctness (the result is a TW)

Immediate, as in §7.1: `ThreeProdDWFast x̄ ȳ = ThreeProdFast (x₀, x₁, 0) ȳ`, and
a DW is a TW with a zero third limb, so `ThreeProdFast_isTW` gives the result.

## Part 2 — the error bound (old paper §7.5)

The five sources of Theorem 8 are unchanged (`doc/thm8.md`) — in particular
there is no `ε₂` and `ε₀ = x₁y₂ ≤ 2u³ − 2u⁴` — and there is **one more**, the
term Algorithm 12 drops:

```
|ε₄′| = |(c + z₃) − s₃| ≤ u·ufp(c + z₃) ≤ u·ufp(6u² + 7u²) ≤ 8u³
```

so the naive numerator is `22u³ − 2u⁴`. The case analysis is *simpler* than
Theorem 8's, because (old paper) "we can consider `s₃` instead of `c` and `z₃`,
which eliminates the case with redundancy":

- **a large `ε₁` or `ε₄` forces `x̄ȳ ≥ 1.5 − 7u`** (`eps1_big_prod_dw`,
  `eps4_big_prod_dw`, reused verbatim from Theorem 8);
- **`ε₅ ≠ 0` forces** either `x̄ȳ ≥ 2 − 5u`, or one of `z₀₁⁺`, `z₁₀⁺`, `s₃`
  below `u²` — the `2u³`-grid argument again, now on the four-limb list.

Three cases suffice:

```
x̄ȳ ≥ 1.5 − 7u                : K = 22u³ − 2u⁴  (naive), with ε₅
x̄ȳ < 1.5 − 7u, ε₅ = 0        : K = 18u³ − 2u⁴  (|ε₁|,|ε₄| ≤ 2u³)
x̄ȳ < 1.5 − 7u, ε₅ ≠ 0        : K = 16u³ + 2u⁴  (one more source shrinks)
```

matching the old paper's own final line

```
|r̄ − x̄ȳ|/|x̄ȳ| ≤ max( (18u³−2u⁴)/(1−4u),
                      (2u³+4.2u⁴) + (16u³+2u⁴)(1+2u³+4.2u⁴)/(1−4u) )
              ≤ 18u³ + 75u⁴
```

(the last case is the tight one: it needs `u ≤ 1/64`, i.e. `p ≥ 6`). The paper
notes the bound is very tight — the binary64 input of §6.3 gives a relative
error `≈ (18 − 2.4·10⁻⁶)u³`.

## Rocq map (`code/coq/ThreeProdDWFast.v`)

| paper object | Rocq |
|---|---|
| Algorithm 12 | `ThreeProdDWFast` |
| result is TW | `ThreeProdDWFast_isTW` (**proved**), via `ThreeProdDWFast_eq` |
| error `18u³+75u⁴` | `ThreeProdDWFast_error` (**proved**) |

Reuse plan:

- **part 1**: `ThreeProdDWFast_eq` (Algorithm 12 = Algorithm 10 at `x₂ = 0`,
  since `RN(z₀₁⁻ + 0·y₀) = z₀₁⁻`) + `isDW_isTW` + `ThreeProdFast_isTW`.
- **part 2 is done**, and almost everything is reused: Algorithm 10's
  `ThreeProdFast_norm_eq`, `innerF_Fnonoverlap` and `sumR_eF_decomp` (at
  `x₂ = 0`), `eps5_bound`, and Theorem 8's whole DW machinery — `dw_norm`,
  the §7.2 term bounds, `eps1_big_prod_dw`/`eps4_big_prod_dw`,
  `err_small_of_round`, `eps0_small_of_z01p`/`_z10p`, `assembly_dw_eps5`,
  `assembly_dw_zero`. New for Algorithm 12: the WLOG wrappers (through
  `ThreeProdDWFast_eq` and Algorithm 10's scale/sign lemmas), `epsp4_bound_dw`
  (`|(c+z₃) − s₃| ≤ 8u³`), `eps5nz_dwF` (the `2u³`-grid disjunction on the
  four-limb list, with `|r₀| < 2` from the product being `< 2 − 5u`), and the
  three-case assembly with `(K,A)` = `(22u³−2u⁴, 1.5−7u)`, `(18u³−2u⁴, 1−4u)`,
  `(16u³+2u⁴, 1−4u)`.
